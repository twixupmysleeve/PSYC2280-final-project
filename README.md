# PSYC2280 Final Project: Convert Images to Damien Hirst Spot Painting

Damien Hirst is a spot artist who paints extremely accurate and precisely circular spots by hand, positioned in a grid. I was inspired by this to create my own version of Hirst Spots that take in an image that is provided by the user, and return a "Hirst-ed" version of that image. You can watch real-time as the program converts the image into a series of spots, producing an aesthetic image of Damien Hirst's style, the major difference here being that his art is very abstract while mine isn't.
